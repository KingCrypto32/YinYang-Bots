Hello Welcome To â˜¯BTC YinYangâ˜¯, 

We Are A Group Of Gamblers and Traders That Gambles and Trade You're Bitcoin for You're Profit and Also for Us. 

Our System Used This Plan :

You Will Get 200% Of You're Investment After Contract Ends, 

Example: 
Invested 1 BTC, After The Contract Ends You Will Get 200% Back And 25% is Divided By Us, So After You're Bitcoin Becomes 2.25 You Will Get 2 BTC while We Get The 0.25 BTC.

Now How We Double You're Bitcoin? 

We Will Divide you're Bitcoin To 2 Parts

50 % for the Gamblers 
50 % for the Traders  

Now This Is Only for Faster Contract, But If You Don't Wan't us To Gamble You're Bitcoin You Can Choose Trade Contract. 

100 % will go to Trading But This Will Take Time.
